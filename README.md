Topic modelling provides a convenient way to analyze big unclassified text. Manual classification of thousands of documents by humans is a time consuming process and one with limited processing power. Advancement in Machine Learning methods provide tools and algorithms that can be applied to such classification. This paper provides a framework for topic modelling, using the topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation from Gensim. The intention of this paper is more exploratory and provide an account of what goes into such a complex algorithm and explore how the modelling process happens. At the end, I look at various ways of evaluating the topics that come forth from this process and their limitations.
